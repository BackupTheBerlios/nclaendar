README!

ABOUT nClaendar:

	This project was meant to be a light but powerful cross-platform Calendar. 
It doesn't need any extra package made exception of wxWidgets. 
No need for too many dependencies, No need for a powerful system, and No need 
for a particular platform to work!!

I worked "hard" for this project... i hope you'll be satified... 
enjoy it!!

HOWTO INSTALL:

	I'll provide sufficent documentation on the website. But if it's not
reachable for you now, i'll give you some hints. If you use this source package
under *nix envinronment... please launch './autogen.sh -enable-stl' and then
type make. you'll have the executable under ./src/ (nclaendar).
Under Win32 systems i'll provide binaries on the website. Contact me if you want
particular ones ;-)
